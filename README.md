# dynamic-masstransfer-model
A dynamic mass transfer model for Iron and Chromium Oxide formation with variable mass transfer coefficients and metal and slag masses. This model dynamically represents the concentration gradient over time when the elements are reacted, i.e. the respective mass transfer that takes place.
